## My first Node.js project

You can check it out on [heroku](http://whispering-river-6949.herokuapp.com/)

###How to run locally

Don't forget to start with commands:

```
    npm install

```
    node app.js

###About application.

This app was created for Web Technology classes.
It helps with learning Japanese language through mnemonics.
The idea is to share your visual association to particular kanji to help others remember them.
